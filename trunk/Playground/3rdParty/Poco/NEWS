Incompatible Changes and Transition Issues:
The HashFunction class template has been changed in an incompatible
way. The member function formerly named hash() is now the function
call operator. If you have defined your own HashFunction classes,
you have to update your code. Sorry for the inconvenience.

On Windows, POCO now builds with Unicode/UTF-8 support 
(POCO_WIN32_UTF8) enabled by default. If you need the previous
behavior, remove the corresponding #define from Poco/Config.h
