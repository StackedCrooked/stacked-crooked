Build instructions
------------------

Make and install:

    $ make
    # make install


Note that 'make install' creates a symbolic link to the correct xulrunner binary:

    ln -fs $(XULRUNNER_ROOT)/bin/xulrunner ~/bin/xulrunner

This assumes that ~/bin exists and is in your PATH variable.


Super clean install:

    # make supermake

    this is the same as:

	# sudo make uninstall ; sudo make mozclean ; make clean ; make ; sudo make install
    
    
This command will also erase the ~/.mozilla directory.

Be careful because this may delete important data from
other XULRunner applications running on your system!


Running the test application
----------------------------

Verify that you are using the correct xulrunner binary:

    $ which xulrunner
    
       => Should be $HOME/bin/xulrunner which in turn should be a symbolic link
          that points to $(XULRUNNER_ROOT)/bin/xulrunner (see Makefile).

    $ xulrunner --version
    
       => Version must be smaller than or equal to 1.9.1!
          XULRUnner 1.9.2+ no longer supports JavaScript/XPCOM connection!!!

Run the test app:

    $ cd test-app
    $ xulrunner application.ini

The component "@stacked-crooked.com/XPCOMSample/CrookedComponent;1" should be in the list of registered components.
If it is not, then XPCOM registration has failed.
