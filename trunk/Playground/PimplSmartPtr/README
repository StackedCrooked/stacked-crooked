This is an experiment to determine if it is possible to combine Pimpl idiom with smart pointers.

Conclusion:

The impl object can be stored in a smart pointer on 2 conditions:

- The main class has a user-defined destructor.
- This user-defined destructor is defined in the CPP file and not in the H file. The destructor may be empty.

If these two conditions are met then it's possible to use either boost::scoped_ptr, boost::shared_ptr or std::auto_ptr for storing the implementation pointer.
