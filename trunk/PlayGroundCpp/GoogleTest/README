How to run the testsuite
------------------------
1. Install the GTest library on your system first.

2. Enter this command:
    make testsuite

  Which executes these commands:
	export GTEST_OUTPUT=xml
	./test

This runs the testsuite and stores the results as an xml file.
The resuling xml document is compatible with JUnit's report format.
