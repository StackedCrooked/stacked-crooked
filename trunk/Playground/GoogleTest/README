How to run the testsuite
------------------------
-> Install the GTest library on your system first. <-

Run:
    make testsuite

or:
    export GTEST_OUTPUT=xml
    ./test

This runs the testsuite and stores the results as an xml file.
The resuling xml document is compatible with JUnit's report format.
